A Dataviz Primer
---
I made this repo to keep track of interesting books, articles and videos about statistics, data visualization, and mapping. The idea is to create a thorough but not overly long primer on data visualization theory and best practices. 

Rather than detailed technical guides, the media in this list are high-level investigations of which types of charts or maps are most effective at conveying information. Anything from blog posts to academic articles to YouTube videos is welcome. 

If one of your favorite pieces of dataviz wisdom isn't on the list, don't hesitate to send a PR!
