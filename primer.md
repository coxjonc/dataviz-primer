* [Graphical Perception: Theory, Experimentation, and Application to the Development of Graphical Methods (Cleveland and McGill, 1984)](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/courses/cpsc533c-04-spr/readings/cleveland.pdf) - This groundbreaking study created a hierarchy of "perceptual tasks" that ranked how good the human brain is at judging values based on different visual cues. It found that people are much faster and more accurate at comparing values based on length rather than area, a big victory for our friend the bar chart.  
tl;dr: "The mode of graph design that we advocate is the construction of a graphical form that uses elementary perceptual tasks as high in the hierarchy as possible."
